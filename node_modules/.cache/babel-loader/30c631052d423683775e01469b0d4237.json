The game is set in the dystopian metropolis of Night City. It is set in the Free State of Northern California. Night City is located south of San Francisco around the area of Morro Bay, CA. During Cyberpunk 2020, Night City is said to have a population of more than five million inhabitants. However, this number is suspected to be considerably larger in 2077. Following an economic collapse sometime during the early 21st century, the United States is forced to rely on large corporations to survive. These corporations deal in a wide range of areas, such as weapons, robotics, cybernetics, pharmaceuticals, communications, and biotechnology; many of these companies operate above the law. The game follows the story of V — a hired gun on the rise in Night City, the most violent and dangerous metropolis of the corporate-ruled future. A robust character creator will allow players to choose Vs gender, visual appearance, as well as historical background — all of which may influence the shape of the game. The world is inspired by the works of authors such as William Gibson (author of Neuromancer) and Phillip K Dick, whose novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and subsequent movie adaption Blade Runner heavily influenced the creator, Mike Pondsmith, in creating the original tabletop RPG.',\n//         link: 'https://www.cyberpunk.net/',\n//         release: '10th of December, 2020',\n//         platforms: 'Playstation 4, PC, Xbox Series S/X, Playstation 5, Xbox One',\n//         genre: 'RPG',\n//         developers: 'CD PROJECT RED, CD PROJECT',\n//         publishers: 'CD PROJECT RED',\n//         inCart: false,\n//         selected: false,\n//         isHovered: false,\n//         isLiked: false,\n//         rating: 78,\n//         id: 0,\n//         cover: \"https://res.cloudinary.com/gianlucajahn/image/upload/c_scale,q_100,w_500/v1658188604/cyberpunk_n6jitl.jpg\",\n//         footage: [\n//             \"https://res.cloudinary.com/gianlucajahn/image/upload/v1658188604/cyberpunk_n6jitl.jpg\",\n//             \"https://res.cloudinary.com/gianlucajahn/image/upload/c_scale,q_100,w_1920/v1658235373/cyberpunk_1_s00vwf.jpg\",\n//             \"https://res.cloudinary.com/gianlucajahn/image/upload/c_scale,q_100,w_1920/v1658235372/cyberpunk_2_mq46xm.jpg\",\n//             \"https://res.cloudinary.com/gianlucajahn/image/upload/c_scale,q_100,w_1920/v1658235378/cyberpunk_3_fajdmi.jpg\"\n//         ]\n//     },\n//     {\n//         name: \"Battlefield V\",\n//         surname: \"battlefield\",\n//         price: \"29.99\",\n//         desc: 'The Battlefield series goes back to its roots in a never-before-seen portrayal of World War 2.

Alongside a heros fixed abilities, each hero has 6 inventory slots which can be filled with Items which provide various benefits and abilities.

During Cyberpunk 2020, Night City is said to have a population of more than five million inhabitants. However, this number is suspected to be considerably larger in 2077. Following an economic collapse sometime during the early 21st century, the United States is forced to rely on large corporations to survive. These corporations deal in a wide range of areas, such as weapons, robotics, cybernetics, pharmaceuticals, communications, and biotechnology; many of these companies operate above the law. The game follows the story of V — a hired gun on the rise in Night City, the most violent and dangerous metropolis of the corporate-ruled future. A robust character creator will allow players to choose Vs gender, visual appearance, as well as historical background — all of which may influence the shape of the game.
